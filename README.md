Learning notes

## Flex
- display: flex;
- flex-wrap: wrap;
- order: 1;

## Patterns
- column drop
- mostly fluid: similar to column drop but add margins when expend over certain width
- layout shifter: box orders can be changed when width changes, extra container may be used
- off canvas: contents are hidden when viewport is small, e.g., the hamburger button; translate & transition

## Responsive table columns for small and large viewports
- hiding table columns using display: none
- no more table for small viewports using display: block
- contained scrolling by put the table in a div and set the width: 100% and overflow-x: auto

## Fonts
- ideal measure (character per line) for web: 65 cpl
- good fonts are at least 16px and 1.2em
